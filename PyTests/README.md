# In College

To run the tests, run the terminal in the PyTests dir and compile the friends_module_test.py file:

    python -m pytest api_module_test.py

If you must run the terminal in the main folder dir then you will need to add a path to the PyTests folder:

    python -m pytest PyTests/api_module_test.py

Thank you!
